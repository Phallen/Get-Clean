The features are described in the associated file: features_info.txt

additional info is found in README.txt

The training and test files were combined into a single dataset with the new, additional flag "Train", indicating whether or not the observation is a member of the training set.

Only variables containing mean and standard deviation data were preserved.

The feature names were simplified by abbreviating "Body" by"B", "man" by "mn", and removing instances of "()".
